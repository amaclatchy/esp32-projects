I borrowed the BIT MAP data from [here](https://iitestudent.blogspot.com/2013/01/displaying-bitmap-on-graphic-lcd.html).   
The original image resolution is 420x200.   

# Displaying images with a width of 240 dots or more   
Crop the original image to this image.   
The image below has a resolution of 420x64.

Convert this image to a 128x64 image by shifting it by 8 dots, and display the converted image continuously.
